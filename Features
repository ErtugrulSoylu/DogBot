What can DogBot do:
  -Play a song from url
  -Play a youtube playlist
  -Can play in different guilds

What to add:
  -Threads are little buggy, i should fix it
  -Can't search for songs in youtube
  -Add a volume command
  -Shouldn't download all the playlist, it should download next song only (i think more efficient)
  -I should add a seek and forward command
